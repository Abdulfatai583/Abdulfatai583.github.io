### Project Title One
*# Heart Attack Risk Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the key factors influencing heart attack occurrences in Indonesia using healthcare data sourced from Kaggle. The primary objective is to identify major risk drivers such as cholesterol levels, sleep duration, stress, and lifestyle patterns. Power BI Desktop was used for data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization to generate insights that support health awareness and preventive decision-making.

## Dataset Summary
The dataset contains over **158,000 patient records**, covering a wide range of demographic, health, and lifestyle variables, including:
- Age and gender  
- Income level  
- Cholesterol and blood pressure  
- Diabetes and hypertension status  
- Sleep hours and stress levels  
- Physical activity patterns  

### Data Preparation
To ensure data quality and analytical clarity, the following steps were performed:
- Removal and handling of missing values  
- Grouping of continuous variables such as age and income  
- Creation of new analytical categories, including cholesterol risk levels and heart attack indicators  
- Structuring the data model for efficient Power BI analysis  

## Key Findings & Insights

### Overall Metrics
- **Total Patients Analyzed:** 158,000  
- **Heart Attack Rate:** 40%  
- **Average Sleep Duration:** 6.48 hours  
- **Average Cholesterol Level:** 199.53  

### Regional & Demographic Insights
- Urban regions recorded significantly more heart attack cases (41K) compared to rural areas (22K), suggesting higher lifestyle-related risk exposure.
- Middle-aged adults showed the highest number of heart attack cases, followed by older age groups.
- Males and individuals in lower-income categories exhibited slightly higher risk levels.

### Health & Lifestyle Insights
- Patients with hypertension and diabetes were more likely to experience heart attacks.
- High stress levels and inadequate sleep duration showed strong correlation with increased heart attack risk.
- Individuals engaging in moderate physical activity and maintaining normal sleep patterns experienced lower risk rates.

## Recommendations
Based on the insights derived from the analysis, the following actions are recommended:
1. Promote regular physical activity and stress-management programs in both urban and rural communities.
2. Encourage early medical screenings for individuals with high cholesterol, hypertension, or diabetes.
3. Raise public awareness on the importance of adequate sleep (6–8 hours) and balanced nutrition.
4. Implement targeted health interventions for middle-aged and low-income populations, where risk levels are highest.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** – Data modeling, DAX measures, and dashboard creation  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **Excel** – Initial data inspection and validation  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how lifestyle behaviors and underlying health conditions significantly influence heart attack risk in Indonesia. By leveraging Power BI for data exploration and visualization, actionable insights were generated to support preventive healthcare planning.

The findings emphasize the value of data-driven awareness, healthy living, and routine health screenings in reducing the growing burden of cardiovascular disease.*
